Stack Calculator ->



This is a simple stack-based calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions written in postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN). It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

How It Works :
The calculator uses a stack to store numbers.
Operators (+, -, *, /) pop two numbers from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back.
The final result remains in the stack and is displayed as output.


Input Format :
The calculator accepts space-separated postfix expressions.
✅ Correct Input (Postfix Notation)
3 4 +
👉 Equivalent to: 3 + 4

❌ Incorrect Input (Infix Notation)
3 + 4
👉 This will result in an error!
